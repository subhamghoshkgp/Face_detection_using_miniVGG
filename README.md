# Face_detection_using_miniVGG
This project implements a face detection pipeline using a custom MiniVGG neural network in PyTorch. It includes data loading, preprocessing, training, and visualization for bounding-box-based face detection.

# Features
1.Custom dataset loader for images and bounding boxes.  
2.Data partitioning into train/val/test sets.  
3.PyTorch DataLoader with custom collate function.  
4.MiniVGG model for bounding box regression.  
5.Training loop with loss monitoring.  
6.Visualization of predictions with bounding boxes on images.  

Refer the VGG16_for_Face_Recognition.pdf for a detailed explanation of the VGG approach.
